# Updated Profile

This is an updated profile page demonstrating previous projects and showing off my various coding skills
Using HTML and CSS I created and styled the page. While this is an updated version of this page, I will go back and update information and content as needed.
This page is used by me to show examples of my work
This page can also be used by recruiters or job posters to look at my work and see if they like it

# Future Additions

In the future I will update with new and completed projects, and possibly a new background image to ease up on the colors and readability.
