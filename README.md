# first-student-bio

This is a biography page about me with links to my work
Using HTML and CSS I created and styled the page. While this is my first attempt at this
I will go back and update information and content as needed.
This page is used by me to show examples of my work
This page can also be used by recruiters or job posters to look at my work and see if they like it

# Future Additions

In the future I will update with new and completed projects, and possibly a new background image to ease up on the colors and readability.
